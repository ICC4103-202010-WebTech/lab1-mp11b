3.-The document has a structure similar to the http protocol.
The news list is structured with different labels in which they store the necessary information to display on the screen. For example, in the <a> tag is the text of each news item and this is found within the <td> tag.
The structure of the labels from least to greatest is <head>, <body>, <center>, <table>, <tbody>, <tr>, <td>, <a>.

4.- In .js file I can see that there are many functions that should give functionality to the page in html and in the .css file I can see that there are many labels that refer to colors and text.
The purpose of the .js file is to determine the functions of the web page and the .css file determines the page format, colors and font.

5.- The browser downloaded the Hacker News main page again. The page downloads seven resources and all are obtained through the get method.
The web server that uses the page is "nginx".
